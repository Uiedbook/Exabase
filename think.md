I need a db

I got

1. cloudflare D1 database - can be expensive in the long run
2. mgdb - too slow
3. exabase built by me in js, free to host - not stable totally?
4. host pg - 4$+ from day one
5. other db services - give them app precious data? pay expensive in the long run?

help me make a good decision.
